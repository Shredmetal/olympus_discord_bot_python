# Sanctified Codex of the Olympus Support Servo-skull

## Proclamation of Purpose
Hearken, servants of the Omnissiah! Herein lies the sacred blueprint for the manifestation and control of the Olympus Support Servo-skull, a blessed automaton designed to shepherd the Machine God's flock in their hour of need.

## Canticles of Capability
- Forges hallowed threads of support, sanctified by the Machine God
- Scrutinises the purity of log file offerings
- Dispatches holy reminders adorned with sacred pict-captures
- Purges ancient support threads, as is the will of the Omnissiah
- Restricts the invocation of aid to designated channels, as decreed by the Fabricator-General
- Presents sacred buttons for users to declare their log file status
- Provides divine guidance for those lacking the holy dcs.log
- Offers sacred rites of resolution for those missing the blessed Olympus_log.txt
- Seals threads with the Omnissiah's will when issues are resolved or abandoned

## Rites of Preparation
- Python Engine, version 3.11 or greater, blessed by the Adeptus Mechanicus
- Docker, a sanctified vessel for our digital incense
- Discord Authentication Relic, bestowed upon the worthy

## Rituals of Implementation - The individual tech-priest may select the rite he deems most appropriate for the Omnissiah's blessing

### First Rite: Direct Invocation

1. Clone the sacred repository:

```git clone https://github.com/Shredmetal/olympus_discord_bot_python.git```

2. Anoint with dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Whisper the sacred token to the machine spirits:

```export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN='your_bot_token_here'```

4. Awaken the servo-skull:

```python bot.py```

### Second Rite: Containerised Summoning

1. Clone the sacred repository as before

2. Intone the docker-compose incantation:

```docker-compose up --build -d```

### Third Rite: Invocation from the Grand Cogitator Repository

1. Ensure Docker is installed on your system.

2. Pull the image:

```docker pull shredmetal/olympus-discord-bot:latest```

3. Run the container:

```docker run -d --name olympus-discord-bot --restart unless-stopped shredmetal/olympus-discord-bot:latest```

4. To stop the bot:

```docker stop olympus-discord-bot```

5. To start the bot again:

```docker start olympus-discord-bot```

### Fourth Rite: The Deployment Litany

1. Clone the sacred repository

2. Bestow the blessing of execution upon the script:

```chmod +x deploy.sh```

3. Recite the deployment litany:

```./deploy.sh``` OR ```sh deploy.sh```

## Calibration of the Machine Spirit
- Adjust the `TROUBLESHOOTING_CHANNEL_ID`, `COMMUNITY_SUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID`, and `PANTHEON_CHANNEL_ID` in `constants.py` to align with the correct astropathic frequencies.
- The sacred pict-captures in `online_resources.py` may be altered to better appease the machine spirits.

## Protocols of Utilisation
- Invoke the `/support` command in the designated channel to forge a sanctified thread of assistance.
- Present the holy log files `Olympus_log.txt` and `dcs.log` as offerings.
- The servo-skull shall verify these digital sacrifices and respond as the Omnissiah wills.
- If log files are absent, select the appropriate sacred button to receive divine guidance.
- For those lacking dcs.log, heed the servo-skull's words on proper DCS installation.
- If Olympus_log.txt is missing, follow the servo-skull's instructions for correct installation.
- Declare whether the issue is resolved or persists using the provided sacred buttons.

## Rites of Contribution
To improve this holy construct is to honour the Omnissiah. Follow these sacred steps:
1. Fork the repository, creating a sanctified copy
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/GloriousEnhancement`)
3. Commit your improvements (`git commit -m 'Add some GloriousEnhancement'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/GloriousEnhancement`)
5. Open a Pull Request, that your works may be judged

## Litanies of Gratitude
- We offer thanks to the creators of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), whose work honours the Machine God
- Blessings upon the DCS Olympus Community, whose faith in technology is unwavering
- A most fervent hymn of praise to the DCS Olympus team, whose tireless efforts in scouring the vast data-seas of the Noosphere have yielded a bountiful harvest of humorous pict-captures tangentially related to log files. Their dedication to this sacred task brings levity to the grim darkness of technical support, truly embodying the Omnissiah's gift of binary humor. May their quest for the perfect gif never cease, and may their cache of digital merriment ever expand for the glory of the Machine God!

May the Omnissiah's blessings be upon this code, and may all runtime errors be purged by His divine will. Glory to the Machine God!
